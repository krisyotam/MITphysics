# Physics Self Study

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Mathematics at Indiana University. Although I am a student at Indiana University, I consider myself a global learner. I prefer online education, allowing me to study from anywhere, and any platform. One of my favorite platforms is MIT OpenCourseWare, and while I am not an official MIT student, I am at heart.

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to self learning Mathematics using [MIT Physics Curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CW8sE9ywo62TN0KBZ6tZdhfpyfhgVe2CL6uUotVR1W0/edit?tab=t.0). 

## Goals

- To utilize MIT OpenCourseWare as a comprehensive resource for advanced studies in Physics.
- To document and track my progress through the MIT course materials.


## Repository Contents

- Course Notes
- Problem Sets and Solutions
- Project Work
- Additional Resources

## Contact

For any questions, tips, or collaborations, feel free to reach out to me.
